    "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the economy hard and has negatively impacted many businesses, but the restaurant industry has been particularly affected. It is of interest to restaurant investors, corporations, and the municipal government to see which Toronto neighborhoods contain the highest proportion of restautants compared to other businesses. This would allow for appropriate financial aid allocations, future investments, and planning for re-opening the economy. The goal of this project will be to cluster Toronto neighbourhoods (Downtown Toronto, Central Toronto, East Toronto, and West Toronto boroughs only) into groups by proportion of restaurants to other businesses."
